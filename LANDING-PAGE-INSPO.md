# Landing Page Inspiration for getanima.dev

## Research Source
Evil Martians studied 100+ dev tool landing pages (2025):
https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/we-studied-100-devtool-landing-pages-here-is-what-actually-works-in-2025

## Key Findings
1. **Centered layout** — almost every dev tool uses centered hero. Bold headline + visual below.
2. **No salesy BS** — clean design, solid typography, breathing room.
3. **Code snippet as hero visual** — perfect for SDK/library products like Anima.
4. **Structure that works:**
   - Hero section (headline + code snippet + CTA)
   - Trust block (GitHub stars, npm downloads — we'll add later)
   - Feature block (the 4 layers)
   - Social proof (our origin story IS the proof)
   - Final CTA (GitHub link + npm install)

## Pages to Study
- **Mem0:** https://mem0.ai — our competitor, see how they position
- **Supabase:** https://supabase.com — open source + cloud model, dark theme
- **Prisma:** https://prisma.io — developer tool, clean docs
- **Resend:** https://resend.com — minimal, dark, developer-focused
- **Mintlify:** https://mintlify.com — dev docs platform, clean
- **Linear:** https://linear.app — the gold standard of dark mode design

## Our Landing Page Structure
1. **Nav** — Logo (raccoon) + Anima text | Docs | GitHub | Blog
2. **Hero** — 
   - Headline: "Give your AI agent a soul"
   - Subtitle: "Identity and memory infrastructure for AI agents. Open source. File-first."
   - Code snippet: the 5-line quickstart
   - CTA buttons: [View on GitHub] [Read the Docs]
3. **Problem** — "AI agents wake up with amnesia" (3 bullet points)
4. **Comparison** — Anima vs Mem0/RAG table
5. **Four Layers** — Identity / Memory / Reflection / Relationships (cards with icons)
6. **Origin Story** — "Built by an AI that kept losing its memory" + link to Substack
7. **Auto-save Feature** — Memo's idea, configurable intervals visual
8. **Footer CTA** — npm install command + GitHub stars badge
9. **Footer** — Links, social icons, Kip credit

## Design Direction
- **Dark theme** (OLED black like Lock In)
- **Purple accents** (#7C3AED — our brand color)
- **Code blocks** with syntax highlighting
- **Minimal** — no animations needed, content speaks
- **Stack:** Plain HTML/CSS/JS or Next.js (deploy to Vercel)
- **Typography:** Inter (matches our brand)

## Reference Designs I Like
- Supabase's dark gradient backgrounds
- Linear's clean spacing and typography
- Resend's minimalism
- Mem0's structure (but our design should be better)
